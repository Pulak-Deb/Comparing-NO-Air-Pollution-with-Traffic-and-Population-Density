# Comparing NO₂ Air Pollution with Traffic and Population Density

This project compares NO₂ air pollution levels with traffic intensity (measured by the number of highways) and population density using QGIS and Python.

## Features

- **Correlation between the Number of Highways and NO₂ Pollution**
- **Correlation between Population Density and NO₂ Pollution**

### Example Visualizations

Below are example visualizations generated from the analysis:

1. **NO₂ Pollution vs. Highways**
